  ## Description:
  The app allows you to create and track daily workouts. The user is able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. They can track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is cardio-based the user can track their distance traveled.

  ## Installation:
  After cloning or unzipping the repo, cd into the "develop" directory in the bash terminal with node.js installed. Type "npm i" to install packages from the package.json (which includes the necessary libraries for the app to function.) After typing and entering "node server.js" the app should be available on localhost:3000 via your web browser.

  ## Usage:
  The user can add exercises to previous workout plans, add new ones to a new workout plan, and view statistics.
